Abstract
========

Ashburton Presbyterian Church is proposing a change and a replant. This document
sets down the goals of the changes and how the proposal achieves them.

Goals
=====

Reduced formality
-----------------

The church needs to welcome visitors and new members. Random persons walking into
the church should not be turned away by insignificant details of seating layout.

Bring speaker and listeners closer
----------------------------------

The "them and us" feeling is stronger when the distance is great. By reducing the
(perceived) distance, we help people to feel that they are a part of the service,
rather than passive recipients of someone else's lecture.

Increase seating capacity
-------------------------

The present arrangement seats a bit over a hundred people. If the church is blessed
with a significant increase in membership, we will need additional seating space.
Also, drastically _reducing_ seating capacity will strangle the church's growth.

Demonstrating change
--------------------

We are engaging in a church replant, and need to reinforce that this is a new
beginning. People who walk into the church for the first time must instantly know
that we have changed things.

Justification
=============

Removing barriers to entry makes the church less offensive in ways that don't matter.
We should always strive to offend people with substance, not form. (Gal 5:11)

Known objections
================

Change for change's sake
------------------------

    "Dr Bumby says 'change' is constructive - that 'different' is good."
    "'Different' denotes neither bad nor good; it certainly denotes 'not the same'."

Merely changing things is not inherently good. Stability has benefits. Any change
must justify itself with more than marginal improvement, as it must overcome the
costs of _making_ the change.

There is a well-known saying that ["status quo wins a stalemate"]
(http://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2011/02/status-quo-wins-stalemate.html).


Conclusion
==========

In order to move forward with the church replant, changes must be made. The changes
described in this document are believed to be Scriptural and practical, and useful.
