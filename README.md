Abstract
========

Ashburton Presbyterian Church is proposing a change and a replant. This document
sets down the goals of the changes and how the proposal achieves them.

Goals
=====

Reduced formality
-----------------

The church needs to welcome visitors and new members. Random persons walking into
the church should not be turned away by insignificant details of seating layout.

Bring speaker and listeners closer
----------------------------------

The "them and us" feeling is stronger when the distance is great. By reducing the
(perceived) distance, we help people to feel that they are a part of the service,
rather than passive recipients of someone else's lecture.

Increase seating capacity
-------------------------

The present arrangement seats a bit over a hundred people. If the church is blessed
with a significant increase in membership, we will need additional seating space.
Also, drastically _reducing_ seating capacity will strangle the church's growth.

Demonstrating change
--------------------

We are engaging in a church replant, and need to reinforce that this is a new
beginning. People who walk into the church for the first time must instantly know
that we have changed things.

Justification
=============

Removing barriers to entry makes the church less offensive in ways that don't matter.
We should always strive to offend people with substance, not form. (Gal 5:11)

Known objections
================

Change for change's sake
------------------------

    "Dr Bumby says 'change' is constructive - that 'different' is good."
    "'Different' denotes neither bad nor good; it certainly denotes 'not the same'."

Merely changing things is not inherently good. Stability has benefits. Any change
must justify itself with more than marginal improvement, as it must overcome the
costs of _making_ the change.

There is a well-known saying that ["status quo wins a stalemate"]
(http://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2011/02/status-quo-wins-stalemate.html).
The explanation here is aimed primarily at language design, but the concept is
more general; change is disruptive and impactful, and almost always in a bad way.
Unless it can be demonstrated that "change for change's sake" is, in this case,
a good thing, the changes [MUST](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) be justified
by something stronger.

Vague goals
-----------

Some of the goals listed above are fuzzy and hard to pin down. For instance, making
the church more welcoming (or, conversely, the reduction of the sense of "them and
us") is hard to prove based on a seating plan alone. These will need to be tested in
a way which gives coherent data.

Falsifiability (testability)
----------------------------

Related to the above is the essentiality of being able to prove or disprove a test.
There is no point performing an experiment if it cannot give concrete results, and
that means knowing *in advance* what the test will be measured against. With the
non-trivial criteria, this means pinning down some measurable result which will be
taken as an indication of a hard-to-measure goal.

Lack of connection with church purpose
--------------------------------------

The goal of a church is salvation, sanctification, education, etc. Nothing in a
seating plan has any direct impact on this, and the justifications must demonstrate
indirect impact.

Core change vs trappings
------------------------

In the meeting on Jan 15th, Barry specifically stated:

    We are NOT just tacking onto what's here; we are making something completely new.

"Completely new" can be best achieved by throwing out everything we have. This means
throwing out what's good as well as what's bad. "Tacking on" can be best achieved by
clearly defining our core values and our core purposes, and showing that the changes
affect the trappings without damaging the core. If tacking on is inherently bad, the
goals must reflect this, and must also set a limit on the newness; without any limit
on the newness, utterly ridiculous counter-proposals such as selling the building and
switching to house-churches will become viable - and more so than the current plans.

Specific proposals
==================

Semi-circular seating layout
----------------------------

Justification: Less formal

TODO: Expand me

More musicians
--------------

TODO: Who do we have?

Sound desk positioning
----------------------

TODO: List our options

Podium instead of stage
-----------------------

With or without removing the physical structure of the stage.

Major concerns
==============

"Barry says"
------------

So far, most of the goals have been justified only by "Barry says this" or "Barry
thinks this would be better". This church is not about one-man goals, so better
justifications MUST be found.

YAGNI
-----

Additional seating space is not a current necessity. It is a well-known tenet that
we should aim for what we actually need, not what we think we might need. Any plan
that gives us at least 100 seats is virtually indistinguishable from any other such
plan; the difference between capacity of 132 and capacity of 117 is completely not
significant *to the replant*. Once experimentation has been done based on the other
goals, considerations about capacity can be considered - maybe that'll be in six
months, maybe in six years. By the time that becomes important, we will have more
data from which to work.

In the extremely unlikely event that we *suddenly* have 150 people in the church,
we can explore temporary options, until such time as we see that it is sustained.
(Even funerals, which (as of 2016) are our best draw-card, don't often fully fill
our current seating plan. We can easily lay out a few chairs temporarily.)

Conclusion
==========

In order to move forward with the church replant, changes must be made. The changes
described in this document are believed to be Scriptural and practical, and useful.
