Abstract
========

Ashburton Presbyterian Church is proposing a change and a replant. This document
sets down the goals of the changes and how the proposal achieves them.

Goals
=====

Reduced formality
-----------------

The church needs to welcome visitors and new members. Random persons walking into
the church should not be turned away by insignificant details of seating layout.

Bring speaker and listeners closer
----------------------------------

The "them and us" feeling is stronger when the distance is great. By reducing the
(perceived) distance, we help people to feel that they are a part of the service,
rather than passive recipients of someone else's lecture.

Increase seating capacity
-------------------------

The present arrangement seats a bit over a hundred people. If the church is blessed
with a significant increase in membership, we will need additional seating space.
Also, drastically _reducing_ seating capacity will strangle the church's growth.

Demonstrating change
--------------------

We are engaging in a church replant, and need to reinforce that this is a new
beginning. People who walk into the church for the first time must instantly know
that we have changed things.

Justification
=============

Removing barriers to entry makes the church less offensive in ways that don't matter.
We should always strive to offend people with substance, not form. (Gal 5:11)

Known objections
================

Change for change's sake
------------------------

    "Dr Bumby says 'change' is constructive - that 'different' is good."
    "'Different' denotes neither bad nor good; it certainly denotes 'not the same'."

Merely changing things is not inherently good. Stability has benefits. Any change
must justify itself with more than marginal improvement, as it must overcome the
costs of _making_ the change.

There is a well-known saying that ["status quo wins a stalemate"]
(http://www.curiousefficiency.org/posts/2011/02/status-quo-wins-stalemate.html).
The explanation here is aimed primarily at language design, but the concept is
more general; change is disruptive and impactful, and almost always in a bad way.
Unless it can be demonstrated that "change for change's sake" is, in this case,
a good thing, the changes [MUST](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) be justified
by something stronger.

Vague goals
-----------

Some of the goals listed above are fuzzy and hard to pin down. For instance, making
the church more welcoming (or, conversely, the reduction of the sense of "them and
us") is hard to prove based on a seating plan alone. These will need to be tested in
a way which gives coherent data.

Falsifiability (testability)
----------------------------

Related to the above is the essentiality of being able to prove or disprove a test.
There is no point performing an experiment if it cannot give concrete results, and
that means knowing *in advance* what the test will be measured against. With the
non-trivial criteria, this means pinning down some measurable result which will be
taken as an indication of a hard-to-measure goal.

Lack of connection with church purpose
--------------------------------------

The goal of a church is salvation, sanctification, education, etc. Nothing in a
seating plan has any direct impact on this, and the justifications must demonstrate
indirect impact.

Core change vs trappings
------------------------

In the meeting on Jan 15th, Barry specifically stated:

    We are NOT just tacking onto what's here; we are making something completely new.

"Completely new" can be best achieved by throwing out everything we have. This means
throwing out what's good as well as what's bad. "Tacking on" can be best achieved by
clearly defining our core values and our core purposes, and showing that the changes
affect the trappings without damaging the core. If tacking on is inherently bad, the
goals must reflect this, and must also set a limit on the newness; without any limit
on the newness, utterly ridiculous counter-proposals such as selling the building and
switching to house-churches will become viable - and more so than the current plans.

Specific proposals
==================

TBD.

Conclusion
==========

In order to move forward with the church replant, changes must be made. The changes
described in this document are believed to be Scriptural and practical, and useful.
